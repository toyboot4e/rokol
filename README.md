# Rokol

Bindings to [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) for personal use. [API](https://docs.rs/rokol/latest/rokol/)

Very early in progress..

## About

### Status

* Rokol only cares about desktop platforms.
* Rokol only supports GlCore33 backend (for now).
* **Rokol is tested on macOS only**. You could find it doesn't compile out of the box. Please open an issue then!

## Notes

My devlog is [here](https://github.com/toyboot4e/rokol/blob/master/devlog.adoc).
