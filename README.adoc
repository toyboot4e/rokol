Wrapper of {sokol} for personal use

Very early in progress..

== About

=== Status

* Rokol only cares about desktop platforms.
* *Rokol is tested on macOS only*. You could find it doesn't compile out of the box. Please open an issue then!

== Notes

=== Relation to sokol-rs

Rokol was based on {sokol-rs} when it was started. Many thanks to them! And the license file was derived from the repository.
