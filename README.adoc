Wrapper of {sokol}, the C libraries for games

== API

== Development

When I set up Rokol, I took many code from {sokol-rs}. Many thanks to them! And the license file was derived from the repository.

== Expected questions

=== Why did you make another repository?

Because Rokol has a different style from {sokol}:

* Rokol uses {bindgen} to create Rust FFI to Sokol
* Rokol renames functions and remove prefixes such as `sapp_`.

One would use Rokol as this:

[source,rust]
----
use rokol::app as ra;

ra::run( .. );
----

Instead of importing all the items in a module:

[source,rust]
----
use sokol::app::*;

sapp_run( .. );
----
