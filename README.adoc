Wrapper of {sokol}, the C libraries for games

Very early in progress..

== About

Rokol is primary for my 2D framework. Please don't expect it to be a complete wrapper for you!

=== Status

* Rokol only cares about desktop platforms.
* *Rokol is tested on macOS only*. You could find it doesn't compile out of the box. Please open an issue then!

== Notes

=== Relation to sokol-rs

Rokol was based on {sokol-rs} when it was started. Many thanks to them! And the license file was derived from the repository.
