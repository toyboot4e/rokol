# Rokol

Wrapper of [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) for personal use

Very early in progress..

## About

### Status

* Rokol only cares about desktop platforms.
* *Rokol is tested on macOS only*. You could find it doesn't compile out of the box. Please open an issue then!

## Notes

My devlog is [here](https://github.com/toyboot4e/rokol/blob/master/devlog.adoc).
